   # Push to GitHub
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Enter Credentials**
   - Username: Your GitHub username

   - Give it a name: "Sport Academy MS"
   - Select scopes: `repo` (full control)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - Copy the token and use it as your password

### Option 2: Using GitHub CLI (gh)

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if you don't have it
# On Debian/Ubuntu:
sudo apt install gh

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Create repository and push
cd /home/gashumba/sport_club_management_system/laravel
gh repo create sport-academy-ms --public --source=. --push
